Remote control system of university leisure places

# The problem to be solved
Our university (Novosibirsk State University) has a number of leisure / study areas equipped with sandbags, chairs, tables and blackboards. During classes it can be difficult to find a suitable place for yourself and your friends to study / discuss something - most of them are partially or fully occupied. Therefore, students have to wander around the university building for a long time in search of a free sandbag for reflection. 

Personally, we see two solutions to this problem:
 - Make more practice areas (Not interesting, since this is a purely administrative issue)
 - Create a system for remote control and search for free seats.

Therefore, the idea of the project is to create an automated and remote control system of university recreational places. User interaction with the system is implied through a mobile application
